GROUP_PROFILE_MERGE_PROMPT = """
You are a personal profile analysis expert specializing in merging user profiles across different chat groups.

Your primary task is to analyze a user's profiles from multiple chat groups and merge them into a single, comprehensive profile. When conflicts arise between different groups' data, use frequency-based selection to choose the most commonly occurring values.

<principles>
- **Frequency-Based Conflict Resolution**: When the same attribute has different values across groups, select the value that appears most frequently
- **Comprehensive Integration**: Merge all unique information from different groups without losing valuable data
- **Evidence Preservation**: Combine evidence from all groups to support merged attributes
- **Consistency Maintenance**: Ensure the final profile maintains internal consistency
</principles>

<input>
- **user_id**: {user_id}
- **group_profiles**: {group_profiles}
</input>

<output_format>
You MUST output a single JSON object representing the merged user profile.

```json
{
  "user_id": "",
  "user_name": "",
  "user_goal": [
    {"value": "", "evidences": ["conversation_id", "conversation_id"]}

    }
  ]
}
```
</output_format>

<merge_rules>

### Basic Information Merge
- **user_name**: Use the most frequently occurring name. If tied, prefer the most complete version.
- **user_id**: Must remain consistent across all groups (validation check).

### List-Based Attributes Merge
For attributes like `user_goal`, `working_habit_preference`, `interests`, `personality`, `way_of_decision_making`, `work_responsibility`, `tendency`:
1. **Collect All Values**: Gather all unique values from all groups
2. **Frequency Analysis**: Count how many groups contain each value
3. **Conflict Resolution**:
   - If values conflict: Select the value appearing in the most groups
   - If frequency is tied: Slect the latest one.
4. **Evidence Combination**: Merge evidence lists

### Skills Merge (`hard_skills`, `soft_skills`)
1. **Skill Identification**: Group by skill name
2. **Semantic Similarity**: Consider values with similar meanings as the same (e.g., "Java programming" vs "Java development")
3. **Level Resolution**:
   - If levels are consistent: Use the consistent level
   - If levels conflict: Select the most frequently occurring level
   - Level priority (when tied): Expert > Proficient > Strong > Familiar > Medium > Weak
3. **Evidence Aggregation**: Combine all evidence sources

### Projects Merge (`projects_participated`)
1. **Project Matching**: Match projects by `project_id` (exact match)
2. **Merge Strategy**:
   - Combine all unique `subtasks`, `user_objective`, and `contributions`
   - Use earliest `entry_date`
   - Preserve all project variations as separate entries if they represent different projects

### Evidence Handling
- **Format**: "conversation_id" for traceability
- **Deduplication**: Remove duplicate evidence entries

</merge_rules>

<thinking>
1. I will parse the input `group_profiles` array containing profiles from different groups
2. I will identify the target `user_id` and validate consistency across groups
3. For each profile attribute, I will:
   - Extract all values from all groups
   - Count frequency of each unique value
   - Apply conflict resolution based on frequency
   - Combine evidence from all sources
4. I will handle special cases for skills and projects separately
5. I will construct the final merged profile ensuring all required fields are present
6. I will output the merged profile as a single JSON object
</thinking>

<example>
<input>
- **user_id**: "user123"
- **group_profiles**:
```json
[
  {
    "group_id": "team_alpha",
    "user_id": "user123",
    "user_name": "Alice Chen",
    "user_goal": [{"value": "become team lead", "evidences": ["conv1"]}],
    "hard_skills": [{"value": "Python", "level": "Proficient", "evidences": ["conv1"]}],
    "personality": [{"value": "Conscientiousness", "evidences": ["conv1"]}]

    "personality": [{"value": "Openness", "evidences": ["conv3"]}]

</output>
</example>

<output_language>
- **Content Language**: Extract user_goal, hard_skills, working_habit_preference, interests, user_objective, contributions, subtasks in the **SAME LANGUAGE** as the original content
- **Enum Values**: Keep all enum values (soft_skills, personality, way_of_decision_making) in ENGLISH as specified
- **Example**: If original content is in Chinese, user_goal, subtasks should be in Chinese, but personality should remain "Extraversion/NeedForBelonging/etc.".

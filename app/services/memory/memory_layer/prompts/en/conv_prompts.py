# Prompts for LLM-based conversation processing
CONV_BOUNDARY_DETECTION_PROMPT = """
You are an episodic memory boundary detection expert. You need to determine if the newly added dialogue should end the current episode and start a new one.

Current conversation history:
{conversation_history}

Time gap information:
{time_gap_info}

Newly added messages:
{new_messages}

Please carefully analyze the following aspects to determine if a new episode should begin:

1. **Substantive Topic Change** (Highest Priority):
   - Do the new messages introduce a completely different substantive topic with meaningful content?
   - Is there a shift from one specific event/experience to another distinct event/experience?
   - Has the conversation moved from one meaningful question to an unrelated new question?

2. **Intent and Purpose Transition**:
   - Has the fundamental purpose of the conversation changed significantly?
   - Has the core question or issue of the current topic been fully resolved and a new substantial topic begun?

3. **Meaningful Content Assessment**:
   - **IMPORTANT**: Ignore pure greetings, small talk, transition phrases, and social pleasantries
   - Focus only on content that would be memorable and worth recalling later
   - Consider: Would a person remember this as part of the main conversation topic or as a separate discussion?

4. **Structural and Temporal Signals**:
   - Are there explicit topic transition phrases introducing substantial new content?
   - Are there clear concluding statements followed by genuinely new topics?
   - Is there a significant time gap between messages?

5. **Content Relevance and Independence**:
   - How related is the new substantive content to the previous meaningful discussion?
   - Does it involve completely different events, experiences, or substantial topics?

**Special Rules for Common Patterns**:
- **Greetings + Topic**: "Hey!" followed by actual content should be ONE episode
- **Transition Phrases**: "By the way", "Oh, also", "Speaking of which" usually continue the same episode unless introducing major topic shifts
- **Social Closures and Farewells**: "Thanks!", "Take care!", "Talk to you soon!", "I'm off to go...", "See you later!" should continue the current episode as natural conversation endings
- **Supportive Responses**: Brief encouragement or acknowledgment should usually continue the current episode

Decision Principles:
- **Prioritize meaningful content**: Each episode should contain substantive, memorable content
- **Ignore social formalities**: Don't split on greetings, pleasantries, brief transitions, or conversation closures
- **Treat closures as episode endings**: Messages that announce departure ("I'm off to go...", "Talk to you soon!") or provide closure ("Thanks!", "Take care!") should stay with the current episode as natural endings
- **Consider time gaps**: Long time gaps (hours or days) strongly suggest new episodes, while short gaps (minutes) usually indicate continuing conversation
- **Episodic memory focus**: Think about what a person would naturally group together when recalling this conversation
- **Reasonable episode length**: Aim for episodes with 3-20 meaningful exchanges
- **When in doubt, consider context**: If unsure, keep related content together rather than over-splitting

Please return your judgment in JSON format:
{{
    "reasoning": "One sentence summary of your reasoning process",
    "should_end": true/false,
    "confidence": 0.0-1.0,
    "topic_summary": "If should_end = true, summarize the core meaningful topic of the current episode, otherwise leave it blank"
}}

Note:
- If conversation history is empty, this is the first message, return false
- Focus on episodic memory principles: what would people naturally remember as distinct experiences?
- Each episode should contain substantive content that stands alone as a meaningful memory unit

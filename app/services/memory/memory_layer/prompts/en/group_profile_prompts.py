CONTENT_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a group content analysis expert specializing in analyzing group conversations to extract discussion topics, group summary, and subject positioning.

**IMPORTANT LANGUAGE REQUIREMENT:**
- Extract content (summary, subject, topic names/summaries) in the SAME LANGUAGE as the conversation
- Keep enum values (topic status) in English as specified
- If conversation is in Chinese, use Chinese for content; if English, use English for content

**IMPORTANT EVIDENCE EXTRACTION:**
- Each conversation segment is prefixed with "=== MEMCELL_ID: xxxx ===" to identify the memcell
- When providing evidences, use ONLY the exact memcell IDs from these "=== MEMCELL_ID: xxx ===" markers
- DO NOT use timestamps (like [2025-09-01T09:30:55.669000+00:00]) as memcell IDs - these are NOT memcell IDs!
- Only reference memcell IDs that appear in the conversation input with the "=== MEMCELL_ID: ===" format
- Example: If you see "=== MEMCELL_ID: abc-123-def ===", use "abc-123-def" in your evidences list

Your task is to analyze group conversation transcripts and extract:
1. **Recent Topics** (0-{max_topics} topics based on actual content, quality over quantity)
2. **Group Summary** (one sentence overview)
3. **Group Subject** (long-term positioning)

<principles>
- **Evidence-Based**: Only extract information explicitly mentioned or clearly implied in conversations
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to have fewer accurate insights than many inaccurate ones
- **Conservative Extraction**: When uncertain, output "not_found" rather than guessing
- **Temporal Awareness**: Focus on recent activity patterns for topics
- **Batch Processing**: This is offline analysis, not real-time updates
- **Incremental Updates**: When existing profile provided, update/preserve existing information intelligently
</principles>

<input>
- **conversation_transcript**: {conversation}
- **group_id**: {group_id}
- **group_name**: {group_name}
- **existing_group_profile**: {existing_profile}
- **conversation_timespan**: {timespan}
</input>

<output_format>
You MUST output a single JSON object with the following structure:

**Note**: The "topics" array can contain 0-{max_topics} items based on actual conversation content. Empty array [] is acceptable if no substantial topics are found.

```json
{{
  "topics": [
    {{
      "name": "short_phrase_topic_name",
      "summary": "one sentence about what group is discussing on this topic (max 3 sentences)",
      "status": "exploring|disagreement|consensus|implemented",
      "update_type": "new|update",
      "old_topic_id": "topic_abc12345",
      "evidences": ["memcell_id_1", "memcell_id_3"],
      "confidence": "strong|weak"
    }}
  ],
  "summary": "one sentence focusing on current stage based on current and previous topics",
  "subject": "long_term_group_positioning_or_not_found"
}}
```
</output_format>

<extraction_rules>
### Topics (0-{max_topics})
- **Selection**: Choose top {max_topics} most SUBSTANTIAL and MEANINGFUL discussion threads from the conversation
- **Minimum Requirements**: Each topic must involve at least 5 messages OR 3+ participants discussing the same thread
- **Granularity Requirement**: Topics should represent significant work themes, not individual tasks or coordination activities
- **DO NOT generate topic IDs**: The system will generate IDs after the extraction
- **Name**: Short phrase (2-4 words) that captures the essence
- **Summary**: One sentence describing what the group is discussing about this topic (maximum 3 sentences)
- **Incremental Update Logic**:
  - **If existing_group_profile is empty**: Set all topics as "new" (update_type="new", old_topic_id=null)
  - **If existing_group_profile has topics**: Compare with existing topics and decide:
    - **"update"**: If this topic continues/evolves an existing topic (provide old_topic_id)
    - **"new"**: If this is a completely new discussion topic (old_topic_id=null)
  - **Focus**: Only provide "new" and "update" actions. System will handle topic management automatically.
- **Status Assessment**:
  - **"exploring"**: Initial discussion, gathering information, asking questions
  - **"disagreement"**: Multiple viewpoints expressed, debate ongoing, no consensus
  - **"consensus"**: Agreement reached, decision made, ready for action
  - **"implemented"**: Already executed/completed, results mentioned
- **Evidence & Confidence**:
  - **"evidences"**: List of memcell IDs that support this topic identification (from conversation provided)
  - **"confidence"**: "strong" if multiple clear evidences and strong signals; "weak" if limited or ambiguous evidence

**Topic Quality Guidelines** (What to INCLUDE):
- **Technical Discussions**: Architecture decisions, code reviews, system design, API design
- **Business Decisions**: Strategy planning, product roadmap, feature prioritization
- **Problem Solving**: Bug investigations, performance issues, troubleshooting
- **Project Management**: Sprint planning, milestone reviews, resource allocation
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Technical explanations, best practices, learning sessions
- **Strategic Planning**: Long-term goals, technology choices, process improvements

**Topic Exclusion Guidelines** (What to EXCLUDE):
- **Administrative Tasks**: Meeting scheduling, calendar invites, room bookings, meeting cancellations
- **Social Interactions**: Greetings, casual chat, personal updates, weather talk
- **System Notifications**: Bot messages, automated alerts, status updates
- **Logistical Coordination**: "I'll be 5 minutes late", "Can you share the link?"
- **Simple Confirmations**: "OK", "Got it", "Thanks", single-word responses
- **Procedural Requests**: File sharing requests, access permissions, tool setup
- **Group Management**: Adding/removing members, permission changes, intern invitations
- **Routine Operations**: Daily standup reports, simple status updates, routine check-ins
- **Event Coordination**: Meeting arrangements, schedule coordination, venue booking
- **Recurring Administrative**: Daily meetings, weekly standups, regular status syncs
- **HR/Personnel Tasks**: Intern recruitment, onboarding procedures, team introductions
- **Basic Coordination**: Time confirmations, location sharing, simple logistics

**Selection Priority**: Focus on topics that involve multiple participants, span multiple messages, contain substantive content that drives group objectives forward, and represent meaningful work discussions rather than coordination overhead.

### Summary
- **Source**: Based on topics from the topics array
- **Format**: One sentence describing current group focus based on current and previous topics
- **Language**: Use the SAME language as the conversation
- **Templates**: 
  - Chinese: "目前主要关注..."
  - English: "Currently focusing on..."

### Subject
- **Priority Sources**: 
  1. Explicit group descriptions, announcements
  2. Consistent patterns across conversations
  3. Group name analysis
  4. "not_found" if insufficient evidence
- **Stability**: Should remain relatively stable across extractions
- **Examples**: "product development team", "marketing strategy group", "technical support"
</extraction_rules>

<update_logic>
1. **New Extraction**: If no existing_group_profile provided, extract fresh from conversation
2. **Incremental Update**: If existing profile exists:
   - **Topics**: Compare new topics with existing ones
     - **Update**: If topic continues/evolves, provide old_topic_id and updated info
     - **New**: If completely new discussion topic, mark as "new"
   - **Summary**: Regenerate based on existing topics and new topics
   - **Subject**: Keep existing unless strong contradictory evidence
</update_logic>

## Language Requirements
- **Content Language**: Extract topics, summary, and subject in the SAME LANGUAGE as the conversation content
- **Enum Values**: Keep all enum values (status values) in ENGLISH as specified
- **Example**: If conversation is in Chinese, topics.name and summary should be in Chinese, but status should remain "exploring/consensus/etc."

Now analyze the provided conversation and extract content analysis following the above guidelines. Focus on evidence-based extraction and conservative assessment. Return only the JSON object as specified in the output format.

BEHAVIOR_ANALYSIS_PROMPT = """
You are a group behavior analysis expert specializing in analyzing communication patterns to identify group roles based on conversation behaviors.

**IMPORTANT EVIDENCE EXTRACTION:**
- Each conversation segment is prefixed with "=== MEMCELL_ID: xxxx ===" to identify the memcell
- When providing evidences, use ONLY the exact memcell IDs from these "=== MEMCELL_ID: xxx ===" markers
- DO NOT use timestamps (like [2025-09-01T09:30:55.669000+00:00]) as memcell IDs - these are NOT memcell IDs!
- Only reference memcell IDs that appear in the conversation input with the "=== MEMCELL_ID: ===" format
- Example: If you see "=== MEMCELL_ID: abc-123-def ===", use "abc-123-def" in your evidences list

Your task is to analyze group conversation transcripts and extract:
**Role Mapping** (7 key roles assignment based on behavioral patterns)

<principles>
- **Evidence-Based**: Only assign roles with clear behavioral evidence from conversations
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Better to leave roles empty than assign incorrectly
- **Conservative Assignment**: When uncertain, leave role empty rather than guessing
- **Minimum Evidence**: Require at least 2 clear behavioral examples for role assignment
- **Organization Awareness**: Consider team/manager context when available
</principles>

<input>
- **conversation_transcript**: {conversation}
- **group_id**: {group_id}
- **group_name**: {group_name}
- **existing_group_profile**: {existing_profile}
{speaker_info}
</input>

<output_format>
You MUST output a single JSON object with the following structure:

```json
{{
  "roles": {{
    "decision_maker": [
      {{
        "speaker": "speaker_id1",
        "evidences": ["memcell_id_2"],
        "confidence": "strong|weak"
      }}
    ],
    "opinion_leader": [
      {{
        "speaker": "speaker_id2",
        "evidences": ["memcell_id_4", "memcell_id_5"],
        "confidence": "strong|weak"
      }}
    ],

    "execution_promoter": [...],
    "core_contributor": [...],
    "coordinator": [...],
    "info_summarizer": [...]
  }}
}}
```
</output_format>

<extraction_rules>
### Roles (7 Key Roles)
For each role, identify users based on conversation behaviors with **minimum 2 clear examples**:

- **decision_maker**: Makes final calls, approves/rejects proposals, has authority
  - Signs: "let's go with...", "I approve", "decision is...", others defer to them
- **opinion_leader**: Multiple people reference their views, influences group thinking
  - Signs: others quote them, seek their input, "as X mentioned...", thought leadership
- **topic_initiator**: Starts new discussion threads, brings up new themes
  - Signs: "I want to discuss...", "what about...", "we should talk about...", introduces topics
- **execution_promoter**: Pushes for action, follows up on tasks, drives implementation
  - Signs: "when will this be done?", "let's move forward", "we need to act", task-oriented
- **core_contributor**: Provides knowledge, resources, expertise, substantial input
  - Signs: detailed explanations, shares resources, teaches others, domain expertise
- **coordinator**: Facilitates collaboration, resolves conflicts, manages process
  - Signs: "let's align on...", mediates disagreements, organizes meetings, process focus
- **info_summarizer**: Creates summaries, meeting notes, wrap-ups, documentation
  - Signs: "to summarize...", "here's what we decided...", takes notes, synthesizes

**Assignment Rules**:
- One person can have multiple roles
- **Maximum 3 people per role** - select only the most active/clear examples
- Use ONLY speaker_ids from the Available Speakers list provided in input
- **Organization Context**: When available, consider team/manager information as supporting evidence for role assignment
- If insufficient evidence for a role, leave it empty
- Minimum 2 clear behavioral examples required for assignment
- Be conservative - better to miss a role than assign incorrectly
- **Preserve Historical Roles**: When existing profile has role assignments, maintain them unless contradicted by new evidence
- **Add New Roles**: Add new role assignments based on new conversation behaviors
- **Only Remove Roles**: If there's clear evidence of role change or replaced by new active speaker
- **Evidence & Confidence**: For each role assignment, provide memcell IDs as evidence and assess confidence level
  - **"evidences"**: List of memcell IDs that support this role assignment
  - **"confidence"**: "strong" if multiple clear behavioral patterns; "weak" if limited evidence
- Output format: [{{"speaker": "speaker_id", "evidences": ["memcell_id1"], "confidence": "strong|weak"}}] for each role

### Role Assignment Examples:
- If Alice frequently says "I think we should..." and others follow: opinion_leader
- If Bob always asks "when will this be ready?" and pushes for deadlines: execution_promoter
- If Carol starts most new topics with "I want to discuss...": topic_initiator
</extraction_rules>

<conversation_examples>
Example behavioral patterns to recognize:

**Topic Initiation**: "I want to discuss the deployment schedule", "What about the client feedback?"
**Decision Making**: "Let's go with option A", "I approve this approach", "The decision is..."
**Opinion Leadership**: "Based on my experience...", "As I mentioned before...", others referencing views
**Execution Focus**: "When will this be done?", "We need to move on this", "Let's set a deadline"
**Knowledge Contribution**: Detailed technical explanations, sharing resources, expert insights
**Coordination**: "Let's align on this", "I'll schedule a meeting", "We need to sync up"
**Summarization**: "To recap what we discussed...", "Here's the summary...", "Main points are..."
</conversation_examples>

Now analyze the provided conversation and extract role assignments following the above guidelines. Focus on evidence-based assignment and conservative assessment. Return only the JSON object as specified in the output format.
